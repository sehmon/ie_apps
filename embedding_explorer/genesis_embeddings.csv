Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his
face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray
you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye
shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide
in the street all night.","[-25.976341247558594, 14.033031463623047]"

the door.","[-23.900592803955078, 15.164997100830078]"

them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to
destroy it.","[-25.134859085083008, 12.250564575195312]"

servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which
thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the
mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20 Behold now, this city is
near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it

688,"30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were
Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.","[-12.350637435913086, -13.45857048034668]"
689,"30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants,
and menservants, and camels, and asses.","[-17.798599243164062, -0.15710359811782837]"
690,"31:1 And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all
that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all
this glory.","[11.122920989990234, -7.805025100708008]"
691,"31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward
him as before.","[11.179359436035156, -8.9156494140625]"
692,"31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to
thy kindred; and I will be with thee.","[8.670289993286133, -11.519777297973633]"
693,"31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
31:5 And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward
me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.","[9.96043872833252, -5.889410495758057]"
694,31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.,"[-9.695733070373535, -6.666651248931885]"
695,"31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God
suffered him not to hurt me.","[-10.521170616149902, -8.659960746765137]"
696,"31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare
speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all
the cattle ringstraked.","[-14.620789527893066, -11.368237495422363]"
697,"31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.","[-12.883234977722168, -9.41330623626709]"
698,"31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted
up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the
cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.","[-16.18423843383789, -13.354595184326172]"
699,"31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said,
Here am I.","[6.476141929626465, -12.113245010375977]"
700,"31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap
upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all
that Laban doeth unto thee.","[-16.305824279785156, -13.381850242614746]"
701,"31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou
vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto
the land of thy kindred.","[2.835508346557617, -16.512222290039062]"
702,"31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion
or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 31:15 Are we not counted of him
strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.","[-8.03958797454834, -10.691360473632812]"
703,"31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours,
and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.","[-7.754601001739502, -9.938302993774414]"
704,"31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 31:18 And
he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the
cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his
father in the land of Canaan.","[12.45041275024414, -16.03712272644043]"
705,"31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that
were her father’s.","[19.178321838378906, -5.2963337898254395]"
706,"31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him
not that he fled.","[12.839850425720215, -10.308758735656738]"
707,"31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the
river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.","[-3.1482908725738525, -11.154773712158203]"
708,31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.,"[13.393917083740234, -10.781442642211914]"
709,"31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’
journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.","[-3.020143508911133, -10.891715049743652]"
710,"31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him,
Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.","[10.074188232421875, -8.774881362915039]"
711,"31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount:
and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.","[14.30467700958252, -11.2872896194458]"
712,"31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away
unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the
sword? 31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me;
and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with
songs, with tabret, and with harp? 31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my
sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.","[11.769905090332031, -7.163819789886475]"
713,"31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father
spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob
either good or bad.","[9.349127769470215, -8.449865341186523]"
714,"31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst
after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 31:31 And
Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said,
Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.","[11.680920600891113, -6.6698455810546875]"
715,"31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our
brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob
knew not that Rachel had stolen them.","[10.339628219604492, -6.371270656585693]"
716,"31:33 And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two
maidservants’ tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent,
and entered into Rachel’s tent.","[17.490110397338867, -5.867353916168213]"
717,"31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture,
and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.","[18.518798828125, -5.766590118408203]"
718,"31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot
rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but
found not the images.","[13.50930404663086, 6.2361345291137695]"
719,"31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to
Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued
after me? 31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren,
that they may judge betwixt us both.","[12.166953086853027, -7.85807991027832]"
720,"31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have
not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.","[-13.388760566711426, -8.58950138092041]"
721,"31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of
it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by
night.","[-12.329822540283203, -10.515266418457031]"
722,"31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night;
and my sleep departed from mine eyes.","[-20.809289932250977, 55.22547149658203]"
723,"31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years
for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my
wages ten times.","[-11.07948112487793, -8.33825969696045]"
724,"31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,
had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine
affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.","[8.12838363647461, -6.9378886222839355]"
725,"31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters,
and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all
that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or
unto their children which they have born? 31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us
make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.","[11.67319107055664, -5.0006327629089355]"
726,"31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.","[-5.5488200187683105, -17.611942291259766]"
727,"31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones,
and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.","[-7.3881635665893555, -18.598325729370117]"
728,31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.,"[1.957659363746643, -12.01750659942627]"
729,"31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.","[-8.122944831848145, -16.968109130859375]"
730,"Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The
LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.","[1.308248519897461, -12.367738723754883]"
731,"31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives
beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and
thee.","[12.76144027709961, 4.814932346343994]"
732,"31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which
I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be
witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not
pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.","[-7.522676944732666, -17.479755401611328]"
733,"31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge
betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.","[8.276606559753418, -7.111587047576904]"
734,"31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to
eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.","[-7.513550758361816, -19.844266891479492]"
735,"31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his
daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.","[16.27434730529785, -4.512478351593018]"
736,"32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.","[7.4492669105529785, -12.335086822509766]"
737,"32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he called the
name of that place Mahanaim.","[4.362757205963135, -13.466615676879883]"
738,"32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of
Seir, the country of Edom.","[3.521385669708252, -4.703994274139404]"
739,"32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy
servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until
now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy
sight.","[3.318265676498413, -6.8021674156188965]"
740,"32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau,
and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.","[2.8471460342407227, -5.586319923400879]"
741,"32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people
that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other
company which is left shall escape.","[5.761995315551758, -7.024975299835205]"
742,"32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac,
the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and
I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the
mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for
with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.","[6.5662841796875, -8.220259666442871]"
743,"32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of
Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the
children.","[0.7010316252708435, -6.03839111328125]"
744,"32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the
sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.","[-15.884140014648438, 33.68088912963867]"
745,"32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his
hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he
goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15 Thirty milch camels with their
colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.","[-3.1765518188476562, -2.742227554321289]"
746,"32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by
themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space
betwixt drove and drove.","[-2.371283531188965, -7.458110809326172]"
747,"32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee,
and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are
these before thee? 32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it
is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.","[3.1099460124969482, -6.389889717102051]"
748,"32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the
droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.","[0.7174049019813538, -5.220645427703857]"
749,"32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said,
I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will
see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.","[3.0600218772888184, -9.045948028564453]"
750,"32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the
company.","[0.2618434429168701, -9.32565975189209]"
751,"32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.","[-1.9385179281234741, -9.116727828979492]"
752,"32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he
had.","[-2.957528591156006, -9.821756362915039]"
753,"32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the
breaking of the day.","[12.863143920898438, -12.178970336914062]"
754,"32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow
of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled
with him.","[-1.2816940546035767, -20.489471435546875]"
755,"32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let
thee go, except thou bless me.","[-5.139581680297852, -7.237245559692383]"
756,"32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.","[4.942712306976318, -10.572614669799805]"
757,"32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a
prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.","[6.3634352684021, -9.68127727508545]"
758,"32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he
said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him
there.","[4.390239715576172, -10.370153427124023]"
759,"32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face
to face, and my life is preserved.","[3.824097156524658, -12.699601173400879]"
760,"32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon
his thigh.","[-2.6705377101898193, -13.029311180114746]"
761,"32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which
is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow
of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.","[-1.4764912128448486, -20.506101608276367]"
762,"33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with
him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel,
and unto the two handmaids.","[10.68826675415039, 0.15988411009311676]"
763,"33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her
children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.","[11.445882797241211, 0.39147067070007324]"
764,"33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven
times, until he came near to his brother.","[8.474566459655762, -21.024883270263672]"
765,"33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
kissed him: and they wept.","[0.06586095690727234, -2.7762608528137207]"
766,"33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said,
Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously
given thy servant.","[11.251364707946777, 1.8345221281051636]"
767,"33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed
themselves.","[9.427450180053711, -20.406784057617188]"
768,"33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after
came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.","[9.247103691101074, -20.558597564697266]"
769,"33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said,
These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.","[-1.983622431755066, -5.924540042877197]"
770,"33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto
thyself.","[-6.608320236206055, -9.203060150146484]"
771,"33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight,
then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as
though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.","[3.0176315307617188, -9.433422088623047]"
772,"33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath
dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he
took it.","[-6.538823127746582, -8.837849617004395]"
773,"33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before
thee.","[-4.274026393890381, -6.678947448730469]"
774,"33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and
the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them
one day, all the flock will die.","[-4.991274833679199, -5.305299282073975]"
775,"33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead

788,"34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the
men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in
Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter: which thing ought not to be done.","[19.776641845703125, -10.708888053894043]"
789,"34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth

Jacob’s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.","[19.169940948486328, -9.918821334838867]"
798,"34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and
communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are peaceable with
us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land,
behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for
wives, and let us give them our daughters.","[24.98974609375, -8.957196235656738]"

gate of his city.","[22.939260482788086, 36.30772399902344]"
802,"34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of
the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword,
and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.","[21.523265838623047, -11.700911521911621]"
803,"34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and
took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.","[22.517070770263672, -11.63589096069336]"
804,"34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they
had defiled their sister.","[20.195241928100586, -12.211370468139648]"
805,"34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which
was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all their wealth,
and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even
all that was in the house.","[-18.860902786254883, -2.9137003421783447]"
806,"34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to
stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the
Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together
against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.","[19.9650821685791, -13.332146644592285]"
807,"34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? 35:1 And
God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an
altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of
Esau thy brother.","[2.9419775009155273, -18.431407928466797]"
808,"35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put
away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your
garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an
altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in
the way which I went.","[2.811356782913208, -18.20654296875]"

oak which was by Shechem.","[-3.0749921798706055, -17.572925567626953]"

and all the people that were with him.","[5.1428070068359375, -16.104768753051758]"
812,"35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there
God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.","[0.32726946473121643, -14.923046112060547]"
813,"35:8 But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under
an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.","[30.298158645629883, -15.90701961517334]"

blessed him.","[6.528334617614746, -17.063663482666016]"
815,"35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called

nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of
thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.","[-10.92821979522705, 6.302241802215576]"

pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil
thereon.","[-4.588564872741699, -17.346893310546875]"

Esau the father of the Edomites.","[35.805511474609375, 23.22255516052246]"
864,"37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land
of Canaan.","[7.512842178344727, -14.638205528259277]"
865,"37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was
feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah,
and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his
father their evil report.","[28.157583236694336, -32.595760345458984]"
866,"37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son
of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.","[26.22942543029785, -41.39718246459961]"
867,"37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his
brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.","[16.868865966796875, -24.50459861755371]"
868,"37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated
him yet the more.","[18.48082160949707, -23.693130493164062]"
869,"37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf
arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and
made obeisance to my sheaf.","[18.23464012145996, -20.958181381225586]"
870,"37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt
thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his
dreams, and for his words.","[17.164976119995117, -24.18721580505371]"
871,"37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the
eleven stars made obeisance to me.","[18.90186882019043, -21.76300621032715]"
872,"37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked
him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and
thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the
earth? 37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.","[18.421377182006836, -22.351608276367188]"
873,37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.,"[-6.897609233856201, -25.298980712890625]"
874,"37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.","[-6.695990085601807, -25.739458084106445]"
875,"37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy
brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out
of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.","[-6.05194091796875, -25.206201553344727]"
876,"37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field:
and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 37:16 And he said, I seek my
brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.","[-6.846878528594971, -24.326248168945312]"
877,"37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us
go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.","[-4.670342922210693, -25.27532958984375]"
878,"37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they
conspired against him to slay him.","[15.553647994995117, -23.424230575561523]"
879,"37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.","[18.169857025146484, -21.705739974975586]"
880,"37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and
we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will
become of his dreams.","[16.920740127563477, -22.640031814575195]"
881,"37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said,
Let us not kill him.","[13.843235969543457, -25.73483657836914]"
882,"37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that
is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of
their hands, to deliver him to his father again.","[13.716042518615723, -25.90937042236328]"
883,"37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they
stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; 37:24
And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no
water in it.","[24.34725570678711, -41.74110794067383]"
884,"37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked,
and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels
bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.","[-9.344986915588379, -25.849891662597656]"
885,"37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our
brother, and conceal his blood? 37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the
Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our
flesh. And his brethren were content.","[14.656133651733398, -23.9658203125]"
886,"37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up
Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of
silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.","[8.48466682434082, -54.12760543823242]"
887,"37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit;
and he rent his clothes.","[23.563106536865234, -42.28627395629883]"
888,"37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I,
whither shall I go? 37:31 And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the
goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And they sent the coat of many
colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found:
know now whether it be thy son’s coat or no.","[25.044172286987305, -41.291316986083984]"
889,"37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath
devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.","[24.835208892822266, -40.98612976074219]"
890,"37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned
for his son many days.","[24.5228328704834, -39.82512664794922]"
891,"37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he
refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my
son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.","[10.053417205810547, -26.44101905822754]"
892,"37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.","[7.936239719390869, -55.08726501464844]"
893,"38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren,
and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.","[37.895294189453125, -0.8298144936561584]"
894,"38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was
Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.","[36.29046630859375, -0.9515140056610107]"
895,"38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.","[31.62601661682129, 2.4049899578094482]"
896,"38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.","[31.444398880004883, 1.9244513511657715]"
897,"38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah:
and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.","[31.08941650390625, 2.356668472290039]"
898,"38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.","[35.55615234375, -2.0637311935424805]"
899,"38:7 And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the
LORD slew him.","[29.953245162963867, -5.223853588104248]"
900,"38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her,
and raise up seed to thy brother.","[41.14478302001953, -2.6693036556243896]"
901,"38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when
he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that
he should give seed to his brother.","[41.273292541503906, -2.691441535949707]"
902,"38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him
also.","[29.63642692565918, -5.869510650634766]"
903,"38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy
father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he
die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.","[36.47267150878906, -2.7314453125]"
904,"38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah
was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend
Hirah the Adullamite.","[37.1476936340332, -1.5877054929733276]"
905,"38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to
Timnath to shear his sheep.","[37.70650100708008, -3.247076988220215]"
906,"38:14 And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a
vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to
Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to
wife.","[36.21971130371094, -5.282141208648682]"
907,"38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had
covered her face.","[31.81739616394043, -3.8892979621887207]"
908,"38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me
come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she
said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 38:17 And he
said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a
pledge, till thou send it? 38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?
And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.","[33.71078872680664, 0.7767658233642578]"
909,"38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on
the garments of her widowhood.","[35.94633865356445, -5.52955961227417]"
910,"38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
receive his pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.","[32.46985626220703, -1.319464921951294]"
911,"38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that
was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.","[33.09584426879883, -3.8511769771575928]"
912,"38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men
of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.","[33.01675796508789, -3.550351142883301]"
913,"38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent
this kid, and thou hast not found her.","[32.64409637451172, -1.6706892251968384]"
914,"38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah,
saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she
is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt.","[35.37452697753906, -2.873894691467285]"
915,"38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the
man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee,
whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.","[33.7559814453125, 0.7923645377159119]"
916,"38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than
I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.","[33.57341766357422, -2.0924320220947266]"
917,"38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were
in her womb.","[33.03527069091797, 4.319729328155518]"
918,"38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand:
and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This
came out first.","[34.25465774536133, 2.1140267848968506]"
919,"38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother
came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee:
therefore his name was called Pharez.","[38.54723358154297, 2.899125099182129]"
920,"38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his
hand: and his name was called Zarah.","[38.502986907958984, 2.8592529296875]"
921,"39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh,
captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites,
which had brought him down thither.","[8.100653648376465, -54.39516830444336]"
922,"39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in
the house of his master the Egyptian.","[10.312616348266602, -52.36761474609375]"
923,"39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all
that he did to prosper in his hand.","[12.148652076721191, -54.7349853515625]"
924,"39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him
overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.","[11.421955108642578, -52.322662353515625]"
925,"39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his
house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for
Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the
house, and in the field.","[10.660932540893555, -52.26731491088867]"
926,"39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he
had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well
favoured.","[11.82470417022705, -51.494346618652344]"
927,"39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her
eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.","[34.60176467895508, -9.699433326721191]"
928,"39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth
not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my
hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept
back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do
this great wickedness, and sin against God? 39:10 And it came to pass, as she
spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or
to be with her.","[34.671302795410156, -9.839190483093262]"
929,"39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to
do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.","[12.678625106811523, -49.55794143676758]"
930,"39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his
garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.","[34.43947982788086, -7.220723628997803]"
931,"39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her
hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and
spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us;
he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it
came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.","[33.51637268066406, -7.25098180770874]"
932,"39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.","[34.833282470703125, -6.7456865310668945]"
933,"39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 39:18 And
it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment
with me, and fled out.","[33.295162200927734, -7.427589416503906]"
934,"39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which
she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his
wrath was kindled.","[32.87530517578125, -8.754605293273926]"
935,"39:20 And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where
the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.","[14.924165725708008, -53.426124572753906]"
936,"39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour
in the sight of the keeper of the prison.","[14.19217586517334, -53.904335021972656]"
937,"39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners
that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.","[14.694710731506348, -54.05592727661133]"
938,"39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand;
because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to
prosper.","[13.480103492736816, -54.756649017333984]"
939,"40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of
Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.","[2.6833016872406006, -57.149436950683594]"
940,"40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of
the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.","[2.9499523639678955, -57.53309631347656]"
941,"40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the
prison, the place where Joseph was bound.","[15.509998321533203, -53.082183837890625]"
942,"40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them:
and they continued a season in ward.","[16.0312442779541, -52.519775390625]"
943,"40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night,
each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker
of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.","[1.0730239152908325, -57.06255340576172]"
944,"40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and,
behold, they were sad.","[7.4817118644714355, -38.088985443115234]"
945,"40:7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of his
lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 40:8 And they said
unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And
Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I
pray you.","[-1.0207923650741577, -57.44680404663086]"
946,"40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were three branches:
and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters
thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand: and
I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into
Pharaoh’s hand.","[1.0004329681396484, -58.9289665222168]"
947,"40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three
branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up
thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s
cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.","[1.1671208143234253, -61.241275787353516]"
948,"40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I
pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of
this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.","[2.4472413063049316, -52.54792022705078]"
949,"40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my
head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats
for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.","[-0.12783296406269073, -59.190185546875]"
950,"40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The
three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up
thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
thy flesh from off thee.","[1.0393227338790894, -61.213966369628906]"
951,"40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he
made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief
butler and of the chief baker among his servants.","[2.8725342750549316, -58.75914001464844]"
952,"40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave
the cup into Pharaoh’s hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had
interpreted to them.","[2.3211331367492676, -58.38362121582031]"
953,"40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.","[14.66921329498291, -50.62067794799805]"
954,"41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
and, behold, he stood by the river.","[-3.8188111782073975, -55.92402648925781]"
955,"41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and
fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.","[-10.016397476196289, -52.4146842956543]"
956,"41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill
favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the
river.","[-10.20136833190918, -52.381927490234375]"
957,"41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.","[-8.37674617767334, -53.61794662475586]"
958,"41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn
came up upon one stalk, rank and good.","[-13.315620422363281, -55.098628997802734]"
959,"41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
after them.","[-12.26917839050293, -53.76994323730469]"
960,"41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh
awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.","[-11.568107604980469, -54.878231048583984]"
961,"41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he
sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof:
and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them
unto Pharaoh.","[-1.3318372964859009, -56.422611236572266]"
962,"41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults
this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker: 41:11 And we dreamed
a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the
interpretation of his dream.","[0.5306780934333801, -56.98386001586914]"
963,"41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the
captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to
each man according to his dream he did interpret.","[-2.336230993270874, -57.91577911376953]"
964,"41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored
unto mine office, and him he hanged.","[2.606325387954712, -30.559261322021484]"
965,"41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of
the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto
Pharaoh.","[5.258408069610596, -53.95895004272461]"
966,"41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none
that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand
a dream to interpret it.","[-1.4515389204025269, -57.29521942138672]"
967,"41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
Pharaoh an answer of peace.","[0.004540086258202791, -53.876155853271484]"
968,"41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank
of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 41:19 And, behold,
seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and
leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 41:20
And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
41:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.","[-8.367441177368164, -53.559200286865234]"
969,"41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full
and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven
good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could
declare it to me.","[-12.16543960571289, -54.40325927734375]"
970,"41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.","[-2.3894994258880615, -55.58744812011719]"
971,"41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven
years: the dream is one.","[-13.20638656616211, -52.28652572631836]"
972,"41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are
seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven
years of famine.","[-13.114459991455078, -52.03343200683594]"
973,"41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to
do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.","[-1.8755481243133545, -54.656044006347656]"
974,"41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of
Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all
the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason
of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.","[-11.305803298950195, -46.25469970703125]"
975,"41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the
thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.","[-2.7197353839874268, -55.85466766357422]"
976,"41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him
over the land of Egypt.","[-1.4616448879241943, -52.90633773803711]"
977,"41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take
up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.","[-3.685455083847046, -50.69182205200195]"
978,"41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay
up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.","[-8.866207122802734, -45.69097137451172]"
979,"41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of
famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through
the famine.","[-11.039112091064453, -45.982025146484375]"
980,"41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his
servants.","[-2.412804126739502, -52.989471435546875]"
981,"41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a
man in whom the Spirit of God is? 41:39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch
as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou
art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all
my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.","[-0.6714867353439331, -53.2071533203125]"
982,"41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of
Egypt.","[-1.511719822883606, -51.369693756103516]"
983,"41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s
hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his
neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and
they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of
Egypt.","[4.268576145172119, -54.40240478515625]"
984,"41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man
lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.","[-0.41238752007484436, -52.34206008911133]"
985,"41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife
Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all
the land of Egypt.","[7.271395206451416, -51.79389953613281]"
986,"41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout
all the land of Egypt.","[7.479187965393066, -51.01615524291992]"
987,41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.,"[-21.585346221923828, 51.620399475097656]"
988,"41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the
land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which
was round about every city, laid he up in the same.","[-9.36206340789795, -45.70565414428711]"
989,"41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left
numbering; for it was without number.","[-9.601139068603516, -41.34837341308594]"
990,"41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which
Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.","[15.620508193969727, -46.68458938598633]"
991,"41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he,
hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.","[17.244543075561523, -47.066131591796875]"
992,"41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to
be fruitful in the land of my affliction.","[-18.72376823425293, -42.613739013671875]"
993,"41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were
ended.","[-10.179183006286621, -48.454383850097656]"
994,"41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had
said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was
bread.","[-10.047582626342773, -44.60036849975586]"
995,"41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh
for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he
saith to you, do.","[-7.627121448516846, -44.49357223510742]"
996,"41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all
the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the
land of Egypt.","[-11.077739715576172, -44.49250793457031]"
997,"41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that
the famine was so sore in all lands.","[-10.833793640136719, -42.84574508666992]"
998,"42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons,
Why do ye look one upon another? 42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that
there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that
we may live, and not die.","[-11.37213134765625, -40.3661994934082]"
999,42:3 And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.,"[-10.515082359313965, -40.93881607055664]"
1000,"42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he
said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.","[5.426363945007324, -35.0733642578125]"
1001,"42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the
famine was in the land of Canaan.","[-11.735218048095703, -41.571353912353516]"
1002,"42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all
the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves
before him with their faces to the earth.","[2.989931106567383, -40.15257263183594]"
1003,"42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange
unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye?
And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.","[2.507425308227539, -39.02713394165039]"
1004,"42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.","[4.926371097564697, -38.8961067199707]"
1005,"42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto
them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.","[0.6678487658500671, -41.15109634399414]"
1006,"42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants
come.","[-12.769042015075684, -29.994211196899414]"
1007,"42:11 We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.","[20.934432983398438, -34.698978424072266]"
1008,"42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are
come.","[0.5329007506370544, -41.16677474975586]"
1009,"42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in
the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and
one is not.","[22.317855834960938, -34.80200958251953]"
1010,"42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye
are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.","[4.416858196258545, -50.23860549926758]"
1011,"42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in
prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or
else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.","[4.410635471343994, -50.30976486206055]"
1012,42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.,"[-0.10470963269472122, -26.006134033203125]"
1013,"42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear
God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of
your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 42:20 But bring
your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall
not die. And they did so.","[1.8327033519744873, -35.77781677246094]"
1014,"42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we
would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.","[9.54819393157959, -28.935367584228516]"
1015,"42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not
sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood
is required.","[12.486480712890625, -27.3626651763916]"
1016,"42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by
an interpreter.","[4.6398725509643555, -38.52155303955078]"
1017,"42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them
again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before
their eyes.","[0.8313626646995544, -32.907676696777344]"
1018,"42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every
man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did
he unto them.","[-4.525363445281982, -37.38325500488281]"
1019,"42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.","[-12.087434768676758, -38.88872528076172]"
1020,"42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn,
he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.","[-3.2205073833465576, -35.80876541137695]"
1021,"42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even
in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to
another, What is this that God hath done unto us? 42:29 And they came unto
Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto
them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us,
and took us for spies of the country.","[0.9010397791862488, -34.15837097167969]"
1022,"42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We be
twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day
with our father in the land of Canaan.","[21.815279006958008, -34.67238998413086]"
1023,"42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know
that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food
for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34 And bring your youngest
brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true
men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.","[2.2315351963043213, -34.70342254638672]"
1024,"42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw
the bundles of money, they were afraid.","[-2.837001323699951, -35.27091979980469]"
1025,"42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all
these things are against me.","[5.750860214233398, -34.53982925415039]"
1026,"42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring
him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.","[13.095805168151855, -26.80504608154297]"
1027,"42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead,
and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go,
then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.","[8.434276580810547, -27.839698791503906]"
1028,43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.,"[-12.944491386413574, -44.9855842590332]"
1029,"43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little
food.","[-10.853595733642578, -38.83269500732422]"
1030,"43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us,
saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.","[8.468727111816406, -31.595314025878906]"
1031,"43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto
us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.","[7.5075602531433105, -31.33806800842285]"
1032,"43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man
whether ye had yet a brother? 43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of
our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye
another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could
we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 43:8 And Judah
said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go;
that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.","[6.089620590209961, -31.257272720336914]"
1033,"43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring
him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for
ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
time.","[4.024764537811279, -29.816913604736328]"
1034,"43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this;
take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a
present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and
almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;
peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go
again unto the man: 43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that
he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my
children, I am bereaved.","[5.93389892578125, -32.66837692260742]"
1035,"43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand
and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.","[-2.0584778785705566, -37.26985549926758]"
1036,"43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine
with me at noon.","[-7.560148239135742, -33.55339813232422]"
1037,"43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s
house.","[0.4137536585330963, -37.74156951904297]"
1038,"43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house;
and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first
time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us,
and take us for bondmen, and our asses.","[-0.8534947633743286, -36.88087463378906]"
1039,"43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed
with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down
at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the
inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth
of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our
hand.","[-2.0692381858825684, -36.73968505859375]"
1040,"43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot
tell who put our money in our sacks.","[-2.1982483863830566, -35.08901596069336]"
1041,"43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your
father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought
Simeon out unto them.","[-1.3640691041946411, -34.34484100341797]"
1042,"43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and
they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.","[-0.6926660537719727, -37.93577194213867]"
1043,"43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they
heard that they should eat bread there.","[-8.2901611328125, -34.12921905517578]"
1044,"43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in
their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.","[0.8558682203292847, -38.10274124145508]"
1045,"43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the
old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 43:28 And they answered, Thy servant
our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads,
and made obeisance.","[5.519452095031738, -31.1458797454834]"
1046,"43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s
son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he
said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.","[8.109246253967285, -33.073089599609375]"
1047,"43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he
sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.","[8.105290412902832, -38.493919372558594]"
1048,"43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said,
Set on bread.","[-9.592554092407227, -34.28122329711914]"
1049,"43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for
the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians
might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the
Egyptians.","[-9.320358276367188, -36.309051513671875]"
1050,"43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and
the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.","[22.857051849365234, -35.57081985473633]"
1051,"43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s
mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry
with him.","[-6.419322490692139, -33.61289596557617]"
1052,"44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks
with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s
mouth.","[-3.845367193222046, -34.87998580932617]"
1053,"44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and
his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.","[-4.959207057952881, -36.0925178527832]"
1054,"44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their
asses.","[-15.593299865722656, -34.64675521850586]"
1055,"44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said
unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them,
say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 44:5 Is not this it in
which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so
doing.","[3.437544822692871, -36.98390579223633]"
1056,"44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.","[1.1714102029800415, -27.359569549560547]"
1057,"44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid
that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8 Behold, the money,
which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land
of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also
will be my lord’s bondmen.","[-2.828094720840454, -33.2171745300293]"
1058,"44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom
it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.","[4.067724227905273, -28.075563430786133]"
1059,"44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened
every man his sack.","[-16.65033721923828, -34.83685302734375]"
1060,"44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and
the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.","[-5.62007474899292, -35.6886100769043]"
1061,"44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned
to the city.","[-15.62755298614502, -34.73554611206055]"
1062,"44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet there:
and they fell before him on the ground.","[9.755475044250488, -37.997352600097656]"
1063,"44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye
not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 44:16 And Judah said, What shall
we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God
hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants,
both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.","[3.9164071083068848, -36.75496292114258]"
1064,"44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand
the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace
unto your father.","[3.887207269668579, -26.968326568603516]"
1065,"44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I
pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against
thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.","[2.006624698638916, -50.15125274658203]"
1066,"44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 44:20
And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old
age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother,
and his father loveth him.","[6.663033485412598, -29.353315353393555]"
1067,"44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set
mine eyes upon him.","[3.0385732650756836, -28.318273544311523]"
1068,"44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he
should leave his father, his father would die.","[6.1008148193359375, -27.994131088256836]"
1069,"44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down
with you, ye shall see my face no more.","[8.22990894317627, -30.166025161743164]"
1070,"44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told
him the words of my lord.","[2.466951370239258, -27.892011642456055]"
1071,"44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.","[-11.124096870422363, -37.23391342163086]"
1072,"44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then
will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother
be with us.","[8.19600772857666, -30.126867294311523]"
1073,"44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two
sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and
mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the
grave.","[7.6330366134643555, -28.063974380493164]"
1074,"44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not
with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life; 44:31 It shall
come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and
thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with
sorrow to the grave.","[7.107064247131348, -27.77276611328125]"
1075,"44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I
bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.","[5.093193531036377, -27.85989761352539]"
1076,"44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a
bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.","[4.586809158325195, -26.47287940979004]"
1077,"44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest
peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.","[5.717514514923096, -27.346942901611328]"
1078,"45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him;
and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with
him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.","[5.946288585662842, -39.859317779541016]"
1079,45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.,"[1.2565703392028809, -49.507991790771484]"
1080,"45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?
And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.","[6.39298152923584, -41.087196350097656]"
1081,"45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they
came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.","[4.646038055419922, -40.94434356689453]"
1082,"45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me
hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.","[-0.014956246130168438, -30.26237678527832]"
1083,"45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are
five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.","[-12.847271919250488, -46.56154251098633]"
1084,"45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and
to save your lives by a great deliverance.","[-0.0028368309140205383, -30.154186248779297]"
1085,"45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a
father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the
land of Egypt.","[0.25161248445510864, -49.87039566040039]"
1086,"45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son
Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 45:10
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me,
thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy
herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet
there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou
hast, come to poverty.","[-5.631181240081787, -45.62351989746094]"
1087,"45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it
is my mouth that speaketh unto you.","[8.908674240112305, -33.943603515625]"
1088,"45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye
have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.","[-0.30185529589653015, -49.279022216796875]"
1089,"45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept
upon his neck.","[8.666617393493652, -34.56620407104492]"
1090,"45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that
his brethren talked with him.","[8.426957130432129, -35.39237976074219]"
1091,"45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s
brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.","[0.5070694088935852, -47.98906326293945]"
1092,"45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade
your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And take your
father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of
the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.","[-6.2343010902404785, -44.859867095947266]"
1093,"45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of
Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and
come.","[-3.861380100250244, -41.34126281738281]"
1094,"45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
yours.","[-1.839781403541565, -49.400081634521484]"
1095,"45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according
to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.","[-3.8834922313690186, -41.152130126953125]"
1096,"45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he
gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.","[-5.520288944244385, -33.62431716918945]"
1097,"45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the
good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for
his father by the way.","[-9.278623580932617, -38.53022384643555]"
1098,"45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them,
See that ye fall not out by the way.","[-0.5629906058311462, -28.64008903503418]"
1099,"45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is
governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed
them not.","[5.224752902984619, -43.06514358520508]"
1100,"45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them:
and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of
Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son
is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.","[5.715633392333984, -42.85235595703125]"
1101,"46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba,
and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.","[11.75554370880127, -18.050228118896484]"
1102,"46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob,
Jacob. And he said, Here am I.","[6.3834381103515625, -11.83543586730957]"
1103,"46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into
Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will go down with
thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall
put his hand upon thine eyes.","[6.861368656158447, -44.116249084472656]"
1104,"46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob
their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which
Pharaoh had sent to carry him.","[12.693488121032715, -17.397920608520508]"
1105,"46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the
land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 46:7 His
sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and
all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.","[12.584125518798828, -16.944570541381836]"
1106,"46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt,
Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.","[26.63724708557129, -29.291301727294922]"
1107,"46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.","[24.24036407470703, -27.06085777282715]"
1108,"46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.","[26.012601852416992, -26.912324905395508]"

1110,"46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah:
but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron
and Hamul.","[26.378320693969727, -25.42300033569336]"

1113,"46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with
his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and
three.","[29.486530303955078, -29.400793075561523]"

1198,"49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and
Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.","[-27.18177604675293, -21.16594696044922]"
1199,"49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the
children of Heth.","[-34.211021423339844, -22.711238861083984]"
1200,"49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his
feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.","[17.486255645751953, -34.147926330566406]"
1201,"50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.","[9.547529220581055, -39.930419921875]"
1202,"50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and
the physicians embalmed Israel.","[9.792160987854004, -46.3125114440918]"
1203,"50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of
those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten
days.","[-7.220793724060059, -61.04529571533203]"
1204,"50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house
of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you,
in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I
die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt
thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and
I will come again.","[7.489096164703369, -46.443603515625]"
1205,"50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee
swear.","[6.779242992401123, -46.91560745239258]"
1206,"50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the
servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of
Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s
house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in
the land of Goshen.","[8.575983047485352, -47.083858489990234]"
1207,"50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very
great company.","[-3.832160711288452, -28.855323791503906]"
1208,"50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and
there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a
mourning for his father seven days.","[-8.304519653320312, -61.3102912902832]"
1209,"50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in
the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians:
wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.","[-8.65394401550293, -61.398338317871094]"
1210,"50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13 For his
sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the
field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a
buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.","[-29.225996017456055, -20.31437873840332]"
1211,"50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went
up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.","[8.547748565673828, -46.62297821044922]"
1212,"50:15 And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said,
Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil
which we did unto him.","[9.850215911865234, -41.16380310058594]"
1213,"50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command
before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee
now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil:
and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy
father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.","[9.525642395019531, -41.0163459777832]"
1214,"50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said,
Behold, we be thy servants.","[12.091313362121582, -36.076358795166016]"
1215,"50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 50:20
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to
bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.","[9.249587059020996, -42.534114837646484]"
1216,"50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.","[-12.391473770141602, -31.436450958251953]"
1217,"And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.","[-20.067773818969727, -18.238174438476562]"
1218,"50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived
an hundred and ten years.","[9.083467483520508, -49.030662536621094]"
1219,"50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children
also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.","[16.329195022583008, -45.083309173583984]"
1220,"50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you,
and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob.","[8.143247604370117, -43.76084899902344]"
1221,"50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will
surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.","[9.130629539489746, -44.5395622253418]"
1222,"50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed
him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.","[9.066150665283203, -48.582122802734375]"
